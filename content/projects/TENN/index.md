A unified, plug-and-play toolbox for building tensor equivariant neural networks (TENN), designed to support communication system applications such as multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) precoding, user scheduling, channel estimation, detection, demodulation, and so on. More information can be found in paper **Towards Unified AI Models for MU-MIMO Communications: A Tensor Equivariance Framework"**, which has been accepted for publication on top journal IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications.
