abstract: |-
  With the increasing number of user terminals (UTs), the interference among UTs might significantly decrease the throughput of the low earth orbit satellite communication system. This paper investigates user scheduling to suppress interference, proposing low-complexity angle-based orthogonal user selection (AOUS) and proportionally fair variants, and designing efficient precoding that reduces to power-allocation problems to balance fairness and throughput.
