abstract: |-
  In this letter, we propose a novel covariance information-assisted channel state information (CSI) feedback scheme for frequency-division duplex (FDD) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike most existing CSI feedback schemes, which rely on instantaneous CSI only, the proposed CovNet leverages CSI covariance information to achieve high-performance CSI reconstruction, primarily consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer architecture. To efficiently utilize covariance information, we propose a covariance information processing procedure and sophisticatedly design the covariance information processing network (CIPN) to further process it. Moreover, the feed-forward network (FFN) in CovNet is designed to jointly leverage the 2D characteristics of the CSI matrix in the angle and delay domains. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed network effectively leverages covariance information and outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scheme across the full compression ratio (CR) range.
