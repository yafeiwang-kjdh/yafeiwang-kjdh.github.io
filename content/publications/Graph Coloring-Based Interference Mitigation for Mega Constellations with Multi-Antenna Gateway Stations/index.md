abstract: >-
  With the burgeoning advancement of mega low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, multi-antenna gateway station (MAGS) has emerged as a key enabler to support extremely high system capacity via massive feeder links. However, the densification of both space and ground segment will lead to reduced spatial separation between links, posing unprecedented challenges of interference exacerbation. This paper investigates graph coloring-based frequency allocation methods for interference mitigation (IM) of mega LEO satellite communication (SatCom) systems. We reveal the characteristics of MAGS interference pattern and formulate the IM problem of mega LEO systems into a K-coloring problem using an adaptive threshold method. Then, we propose a tailored graph coloring algorithm called Clique-Based Tabu Search (CTS), which leverages the unique clique structure brought by MAGSs to achieve outstanding IM performance. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
